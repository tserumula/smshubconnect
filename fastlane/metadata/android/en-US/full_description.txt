SMSHub Connect is an SMS Gateway application for Android devices, developed in Kotlin using Android Studio. The app connects to a server via HTTP to periodically retrieve SMS messages in JSON format that need to be sent. It handles message dispatch, tracks delivery status, and provides notifications for incoming messages.

Commercial SMS APIs are often prohibitively expensive for many use cases. As an alternative, you can use your own phone line to send SMS messages by setting up an Android phone as a gateway.

While other SMS gateway projects exist, none that I found at the time of starting this project offered a straightforward, free solution for sending and receiving SMS via an HTTP API without commercial dependencies.
